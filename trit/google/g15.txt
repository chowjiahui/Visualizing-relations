WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress plan to unveil legislation on Wednesday to reinstate "net neutrality" rules that were repealed by the Trump Administration in December 2017, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

Pelosi told lawmakers in a letter that Democrats will unveil the "Save The Internet Act" on Wednesday.

The Federal Communications Commission repealed the rules that bar providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid "fast lanes." The repeal was a win for providers like Comcast Corp <CMCSA.O), AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, but was opposed by internet companies like Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O.
