From:\tJae Yang (GOLDMAN SACHS (ASIA)) <jhy12@bloomberg.net>\r\nSent:\tWednesday, 8 November, 2017 8:56 AM\r\nTo:\tJAE.YANG@GS.COM\r\nSubject:\tDaily Actionable Ideas 11/8: Still short Kubota, Isetan, Unicharm.\r\n\r\n(the short sighted sales view, not Research) (max loss on short recommendations unlimited) SHORT \r\nKUBOTA {6326 Equity}: WOW. I was totally wrong on the incentives cohort. And yet the co still missed.  \r\nDeere taking market share seems to be coming into fruition with no real pushback from Kubota up until \r\nnow, but now the co has mentioned it will start to raise incentives going forward in order to retain its \r\nshare.  On the back of a positive US macro backdrop, GS Research had \x93expected Kubota to build up its \r\ninventory in FY12/17, and that this would lead to an increase in wholesale shipments and higher \r\nutilization gains, but it now appears that this will not materialize.\x94\r\nThe topline revision upwards seems to be mainly FX- so nothing to get excited about here as well.\r\nIt\x92s been a tough short, but happy to keep it on as the outlook remains tough. \r\nFULL RESEARCH COMMENT: \r\nhttps://research.gs.com/services/documentRedirect?id=023d332a77a24685a7939fd32acd0583\r\n \r\nISETAN MITSUKOSHI {3099 Equity}, MIXED FEELINGS ON MT PLAN, BUT STILL SHORT: the headlines of \r\nOP 35bn for the midterm plan look positive, but details as to how to achieve this number seems a bit \r\nunrealistic.  Everything that has been mentioned, personnel costs, etc is not surprising, and the earnings \r\nitself given the preview the day before also not a surprise.  \r\nKEY POINTS, 2 negatives, 1 positive?\r\n?OP Y7.6 bn IL, \x93essentially in line with our expectations (GSe \xa58.1 bn) and the November 6 Nikkei \r\nearnings preview for about \xa57.5 bn\x94\r\n?Growth of 1.5% WTE\x85 \x93yoy growth was still somewhat disappointing when compared with H20 \r\nRetailing at +5% and Takashimaya at +3%. Merchandise gross margin fell 0.23pp\x94\r\n?OP of Y35bn = Net profit of Y22bn = P/E of 21x\x85 doesn\x92t look massively expensive given its historical \r\nlevels\x85 GS RESEARCH NOTE: \r\nhttps://360.gs.com/research/portal?action=action.binary&d=e9e1e10489b140b7ab46f86db7366f28&r=\r\n1\r\n \r\nSHORT UNICHARM {8113 Equity} INTO RESULTS: I\x92m looking at Shokubai earnings\x85 I\x92m looking at this \r\nmassive rally in oil prices, I\x92m looking at LION earnings, and I\x92m looking at yen weakness, and I\x92m looking \r\nat a bull market. And it just seems like the cost side inflation could just be something that could hurt the \r\nconsumer sector which seems to have slowed down obviously on the back of fairly high hurdles last year. \r\nIndia biz was something that could have been an upside risk\x85 but the fire perhaps will stunt growth near \r\nterm\x85 (won\x92t be reflected in the July \x96 Sep results obviously). \r\nVALUATIONS at 13x fwd EV/EBITDA- not rich vs its peers but not cheap either.\r\nINDIA FIRE: https://www.nonwovens-industry.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2017-10-25/fire-\r\nreported-at-unicharm-india\r\nGS SHOKUBAI NOTE: \r\nhttps://360.gs.com/gir/portal?action=action.doc&d=a2a76c4431634eab9a7e391d847d6db5\r\n \r\n<Previous comments>\r\n<Kubota comment from Nov 7>\r\nSTILL SHORT KUBOTA {6326 Equity} \x96 gentle reminder. Earnings out today, the thesis remains the \r\n\x93incentives cohort.\x94 Catalyst post today, there is the GS Ag conference in Boston- \x93In terms of other \r\ninfrastructure-related machinery, we remain cautious on Kubota and Makita as here are still concerns \r\nabout sales promotion costs, sales prices, and sales mix trends.\x94 \r\nDEERE vs KUBOTA, in case you want to buy one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkVqe1I2e6k\r\nLATEST RESEARCH NOTE: \r\nhttps://360.gs.com/research/portal?action=action.binary&d=5f8778480d83455592208948938de5ad&r\r\n=1\r\n<comment from Oct 17>\r\nSHORT KUBOTA {6326 Equity}: Despite a positive US recovery cycle, focus on pricing- US Machinery \r\nanalyst with the latest views on the sector with a positive view on Ag Machinery in addition to \r\nConstruction machinery while neutral on Engineering. Whilst the positive tone with early stages of \r\nrecovery in the market, the thesis on Kubota continues to remain pricing while Deere could aggressively \r\ntake share thru its lower cost product where margins are neutral to positive given the redesigning of its \r\nproduct- the same thing took place in Brazil where AGCO market share went from 10% to 4%, given \r\nDeere\x92s lower pricing model while Deere\x92s margins were neutral to positive. \r\nVALUATIONS slightly a tough case here -both stocks (Kubota and Deere) have converged at around 17x \r\n(berg consensus)\x85 and Kubota fwd P/E remains in the middle of its range, but with consensus OP fairly \r\nbullish with 220bn median estimate vs GSE at 207bn (10% growth vs flat yoy)\x85 CATALYST would be the \r\nGS Nov 14 Ag conference in Boston where Agco is presenting- I would be keen on hearing what they \r\nhave to say about the markets hare environment.  \r\n \r\n<Isetan comment from 10/27>\r\nSHORT ISETAN {3099 Equity} just in case you missed my comment on Friday\x85 I was just thinking about \r\nthis whole shift to Korea from Japan in cosmetics- and the move on the dept stores yesterday triggered \r\ninterest. We\x92ve already seen the underperformance of Isetan vs J Front on the longer term but since \r\nthen the past 6 months have been trending in line.\r\nKawano agrees that there is more downside here, just wondering if further Korea news can trigger it.\r\nWHY I LIKE THIS TRADE: \r\n1) It plays with the shift to Korea theme,\r\n2) historical valuation px action over 30x,\r\n3) tech disruption like Farfetch/shift to online consumer,\r\n4) despite wage growth with millennials,  money spent on experience rather than \x93things\x94\r\nGS RESEARCH: https://research.gs.com/content/research/en/reports/2017/10/25/16f23fa7-871e-4510-\r\nb7a0-4bf4cf9fbef3.sitePilot.html\r\n \r\nGood luck.\r\n \r\nBest,\r\n \r\nJae\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis is not a solicitation and does not take into account the investment objectives of individual clients. \r\nPrepared based upon info believed reliable.
