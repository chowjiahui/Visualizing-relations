There were significant FX gains YTD, boosting reported net income, and we believe strong share price performance post results was largely driven by the appreciating RMB. Looking past FX, Air China\x92s adjusted net income was above our expectations on cost controls, CSA was in line and CEA slightly below. We maintain Sell on CSA as we see under-appreciated potential drags on domestic demand in 2018: 1) Expansion to lower yielding routes amidst congestion in key hubs; 2) Persistently poor on-time performance is structural, with the high-speed rail (HSR) an increasingly attractive alternative; 3) Tightening bias of China\x92s monetary policy and a potentially less supportive fiscal policy could drag on travel demand; CSA has highest exposure to domestic. \r\n1) Regulation caps frequency growth, flying further to compensate \r\nCAAC announced a cap on domestic flight frequency growth at select key airports in Sep\x9217 to improve on-time rates. Chinese airlines are reacting by flying longer routes to drive ASK growth. We think that while frequency restrictions are supportive to fares at capacity constrained trunk routes, profitability on new routes may drag due to set-up costs, unstable demand. \r\n2) Domestic yields lower than expected\x85 \r\nCompany managements attributed recent weaker domestic load factors and softer-than-expected yields to adverse weather conditions, resulting in travelers switching to the more reliable HSR. \r\n3) \x85but offset by better international recovery \r\nGood performance on China-Europe/Japan/Hong Kong routes were also flagged by company managements, though China-US/ANZ was soft due to excessive capacity growth. \r\nRevise EPS by -12% to +10%, TPs by -5% to +1% \r\nWe revise our EPS by -12% to +10% and adjust our EV/GCI vs. CROCI/ WACC-based 12-mth TPs by -5% to +1% for our coverage. Maintain Sell on CSA (A/H-shares) and Neutral on Air China and CEA. Risks: (+): Lifting of domestic fare ceiling on some routes, SOE cargo reform for Air China / CSA; (-): Higher costs, particularly fuel, lower travel demand, poor on-time rates may result in travelers opting for HSR as an alternative. \r\nClick here to read more \r\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Hartwright, CFA (Hong Kong) +852-2978-0953, Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C.\r\nVincent Lim (Hong Kong) +852-2978-6958, Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C.\r\nWendy Chen (Hong Kong) +852-2978-2679, Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease click here to access the Asia Equity Research Landing Page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo provide feedback, please click here\r\r\n________________________________________\r\nTo change your interests or unsubscribe (if you no longer wish to receive these messages), please click the following:\r\nhttps://360.gs.com/gir/portal/research/alertsetup \r\n\r\nLegal Disclaimers & Disclosures: \r\nhttps://360.gs.com/gs/portal?action=redirect&redirect.alias=disclaimers \r\n\r\nImportant Information About Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research:\r\nhttps://360.gs.com/gir/portal?action=redirect&redirect.node=navigation.portal.disclaimer.ir \r\n\r\nContact Us: \r\ngs360help@gs.com \r\nUS & Canada 1-866-727-7000\r\nThe Americas 1-212-357-9994\r\nEurope & Africa 44-20-7552-2555\r\nAsia 81-3-6437-4844\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\nThis email has been scanned by the Symantec Email Security.cloud service.\r\nFor more information please visit http://www.symanteccloud.com
