Both leaders (CL buy Yili and Buy \r\nMengniun) have gained 300bp mkt share ytd. We expect further reduction in A&P to be next key profit \r\ndrive amid industry cost upcycle. Lincoln's bull case if Yili outgrows industry by 10% through premium \r\nbrand positioning of new products and more A&P reduction, we could see 33% EPS CAGR and hence 42% \r\nupside from here. Mengniu's OPM has lagged Yili by 350bp this year but multiple tailwinds at works - 1) \r\nbetter procurement policy, upstream biz turnaround and reduction in A&P. \r\nChina\x92s new taste FAQs | We see broader recovery in China staples space but vary by category with \r\nchilled yogurt and premium UHT milk growing fastest. As product life cycle shortens and online \r\ndisruption more prevalent, we favour names with strong brand positions and innovation ability. Buy Dali, \r\nproven track records in new products and multi brand strategy, see Doubendou a bn sales this year and \r\ncontribute 13% of profit by 2019e, TP raised to HK$6.90. Zhouheiya, store expansion story, topline \r\ngrowth to offset cost pressure. \r\nParadise beat | good call by Alex. 3Q beat, thanks to higher-than-expected hotel revenue, stronger \r\noperating leverage and strong performance at P-City. Alex raised TP by 40% to W25500 based on a \r\nhigher EV/post-tax EBITDA multiple of 17x (mid cycle) vs 13x prior. His OP# is 60-70% above street and \r\nexpect China tourism recovery continues to drive upward revision. Mgmt.
