Investors we met with were broadly positive on this year's consumption \r\nrecovery in China, and focused on the next growth driver for the sector, as well as how incumbents can \r\ncompete with rising niche brands. We answer their commonly asked questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ1: How sustainable is the demand recovery into 2018? \r\nWe see the better demand in 2017 as reflecting a combination of a stronger economy, higher FAI, \r\nproperty wealth effects and favorable weather. Demand in lower-tier cities is the main growth driver \r\ngiven relatively low penetration. For 2018, we see the broad recovery continuing. However, we expect it \r\nto vary by category, with dairy likely to see continued strength. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ2: How can incumbents battle channel shift and niche brands?\r\nProduct lifecycles are shortening, and online disruption is becoming more prevalent in F&B segments. \r\nThis has driven a more fragmented market in the past three years. We believe incumbents need to \r\nactively develop new products, focus on branding vs. distribution, and pursue more M&A.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ3: Dairy - what is the next major growth driver for Yili/Mengniu?\r\nOver the next two years, we expect chilled yogurt and premium UHT milk to remain the faster growth \r\ncategories while the UHT yogurt category gradually matures. We estimate probiotic drinks (soy, walnut \r\nmilk etc.) are a potential Rmb82bn market by 2020, with no current leading premium brand. Global \r\nexpansion may be another avenue for Yili/Mengniu to reach Rmb100bn in sales around 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ4: Dali - how big is the soy milk market and how is competition?\r\nDali's newly launched soy milk, Doubendou, has reached monthly sales of c.Rmb150-200mn in past two \r\nmonths, with sales likely to exceed Rmb1bn this year. We see a potential Rmb20bn packaged soy milk \r\nmarket in China in three years, and Dali as the current front runner in national distribution. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ5: ZHY - what is margin trend with competition / channel shift?\r\nInvestors were concerned about ZHY's ASP discounts, and cost pressure amid more intense competition. \r\nWe consider its current ASP stabilized, and think its premium branding should support premium pricing. \r\nFurthermore, ZHY still has ample room to expand store count (double the current level).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln Kong, CFA (Hong Kong) +852-2978-6603 Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C.\r\nYuqing Li (Singapore) +65-6654-5328 Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte\r\nXufa Liao, CFA (Shanghai) +86(21)2401-8902 Beijing Gao Hua Securities Company Limited\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.
