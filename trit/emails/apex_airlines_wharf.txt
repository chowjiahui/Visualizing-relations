China \r\nPMI has recently slowed but indicators for other markets remain strong esp Korea. In November, based \r\non earnings revision projections, Richard thinks the four long sectors are Old Tech, Materials, Industrials \r\nand Energy, and four short sectors are Real Estate, Insurance, Consumer Discretionary and Consumer \r\nStaples. Buy-rated names include CNOOC, Samsung Electronics and Alumina (all on Conviction List). Sell-\r\nrated names include Nestle India, Hyundai Wia and Great Wall Motor\r\nAirlines | market hasn\'t fully baked in potential drags on domestic demand in 208 on 1) expansion to \r\nlower yielding routes; 2) poor on-time performance with High Speed Rail a very attractive alternative; 3) \r\ntightening bias of monetary policy could drag on travel demand. China Southern has the highest \r\nexposure to domestic, sell. We see upside risks on CEA and AC given intl traffic strength and lifting of \r\ndomestic fare ceiling. Top pick CX, +ve from news that HK Express is banned from adding new services \r\nnext 6 mths.\r\nWharf spin-off | Simon published SOTP analysis for Wharf Holdings, evaluating the valuation Wharf REIC \r\nand remainco, using peer NAV discount and/or dividend yields, as a guide. We also provide scenario \r\nanalysis on further potential upside, if Remaining Wharf were to be acquired by its 60% controlling \r\nowner, Wheelock.it would imply an SOTP valuation of HK$87-100, implying 18-35% upside \r\nAdidas read across | stock down -5% on sales miss but China remains intact.  Footwear continues to \r\noutperform apparel, which should benefit Yue Yuen. Shenzhou should continue to reap market share \r\ngains. 4Q should see sales growth reaccelerating, and profit margin expansion is strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNetease \r\nBuy - Q3 \r\nPreview All \r\neyes will \r\nbe on the \r\ntiming of \r\nmonetizati\r\non of \r\nMineCraft, \r\nthe \r\nmonetizati\r\non \r\npotential \r\nof \r\nWildness/T\r\nerminator \r\n2, the \r\nprogress \r\nwith \r\nMultiplaye\r\nr Online \r\nBattle \r\nArena \r\n(MOBA) \r\ngenre and \r\ncorporatio\r\nn plan with \r\nBlizzard \r\nnext year. \r\nWe expect \r\ngames \r\ngrowth to \r\nstabilize in \r\n4Q and see \r\ngreater \r\nvisibility in \r\nterms of \r\npipeline \r\nnext year.\r\n\r\nJD.com \r\nBuy - Q3 \r\nPreview \r\nWe \r\nprovide \r\nread-\r\nacross \r\nfrom \r\noffline \r\nretailers\' \r\nsequential \r\nmargin \r\nimprovem\r\nent in 3Q \r\nand note \r\nthe \r\ndownward \r\nmove in \r\nconsensus \r\nmargin \r\nexpectatio\r\nns over the \r\npast \r\nmonth \r\nthat we \r\nthink could \r\nposition JD \r\nfor beating \r\nnow-\r\nlowered \r\n3Q \r\nconsensus \r\nestimates.\r\n\r\nEvent\r\n\r\nStart of \r\nsomething \r\nbigger in \r\nthe US? \r\nLow \r\nvolatility \r\nhas been a \r\nhallmark \r\nof the \r\nyear-long \r\nequity rally \r\ncreating \r\ninexpensiv\r\ne hedges. \r\nThe VIX \r\nhas indeed \r\npopped up \r\na point \r\nand is near \r\n11.
