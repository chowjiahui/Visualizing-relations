Siegel, CFA - ILLC\r\n  +1 212-310-5455\r\n\r\nGiven the many positive holiday sales headlines & recognizing 4Q over-indexes to apparel, we took a deep dive into AMZN\x92s apparel business and its go forward oppty in the very large category w/already above-average GMs and ecomm penetration. Bottom line, and recognizing many variables, we could see AMZN\x92s global apparel GMV grow meaningfully to $45-85bn by FY20 (2-4x WMT\x92s est FY16 U.S. apparel), generating ever more GP dollars to deploy .\r\n?\tWhy pursue apparel? Apparel/accessories represent an attractive target: global sales north of $1Tn w/above avg online penetration & leading GM vs. other categories (fig 2), and as detailed in our AMZN Margin Deep Dive, growth in higher GM segments is key to funding moat-digging investment. \r\n?\tAMZN is already one of, if not the largest apparel retailer; math yields $45-85bn in apparel sales by FY20. A 10-20% range (peer analysis on pg. 3), would have translated to $18-36bn in FY16 AMZN apparel GMV, enveloping WMT U.S. & Macy\x92s apparel sales of $25/22bn. Our assumptions suggest $45-65bn of global apparel GMV by FY20 (analysis on pg. 3).\r\n?\tSo why isn\x92t growth capped? We believe AMZN has the largest TAM (ever), doesn\x92t carry socio-economic retailing stigmas, can stock limitless # of goods on its virtual shelf & knows customers better than they do. Pg. 4. \r\n?\tAMZN\x92s success w/books offers interesting proxy. AMZN\x92s path to book dominance provides a potential roadmap for apparel success, with its FY07 media progress sharing similarities to its FY17 apparel achievements, fig 5. \r\n?\tPrivate label could drive $1.6bn in GP. Avg private label (fig 11) on existing sales could have generated an incremental ~$500mn of GP and PL growth going forward could drive $1.6bn of incremental GP. See detailed private label analysis beginning on pg. 6 and sensitivity analysis in fig 12. \r\n?\tBuy your way onto AMZN\x92s best seller list. Interestingly, we observed that brands offering promos during the holiday weekend saw meaningful boosts on top seller lists. Of note were UA, Adidas & CK, see figs 15-17. \r\n?\tAMZN doesn\x92t sell like others. With less focus on eking last bits of profit, AMZN\x92s desire to rapidly move inventory could potentially benefit Off-Price. \r\n?\tAt this point, AMZN apparel does best with basics. Analyzing AMZN\x92s best-selling clothing shows an apparel business awash in basics.
